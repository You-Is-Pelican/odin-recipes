            <li>1 red onion - peeled and finely sliced</li>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Place the red lentils into a pan of boiling water over a medium heat and cook until soft, about 25 minutes.<br> Drain and place to one side to cool.</li>
            <li>Once cool, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well, adding a little dash of water if the mixture feels too dry.<br> Leave the mixture to one side for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scoop out large spoonfuls of the mixture and form them into patty shapes using your hands.<br> The mixture should make around 12 fritters.</li>
            <li>Heat some coconut oil in a frying pan. Once really hot, place 3-4 fritters in the pan and cook for 5-10 minutes on each side.<br> They should be golden on the outside and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Tell only those who won't listen.</li>
