        <h3>A Recipe for a Plant-Based Cherry Bakewell!</h3>
        <p>This is my favouite cake. There's little more to say.<br>
        The pairing of cherry and almond is nothing new,<br>
         but the way this recipe balances these flavours,<br>
         how they are suspended in the richest and fluffiest of sponges is.<br>
         Or at least it was to me. Give it a go.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>230 g (1 + ¾ cups + 2 Tbsp) plain (all-purpose) flour</li>
            <li>175 g (6 oz) ground almonds</li>
            <li>230 g (1 cup + 2 Tbsp) caster (superfine) sugar</li>
            <li>3 ½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
            <li>140 ml (½ cup + 4 tsp) neutral oil (I like sunflower, olive or avocado)</li>
            <li>350 ml (1 + ⅓ cups + 2 Tbsp) unsweetened non-dairy milk (soy is best)</li>
            <li>1 tsp almond extract (or vanilla)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp cider or white wine vinegar (or lemon juice)</li>
            <li>250 g (9 oz) pitted cherries (frozen or fresh)</li>
            <li>a couple of handfuls of flaked almonds</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/350°F/gas mark 4. Grease a 23 x 33 cm / 9 x 13 inch rectangular cake tin and line it with baking parchment</li>
            <li>Place the flour, ground almonds, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and stir with a balloon whisk until well combined</li>
            <li>Add the oil, milk, almond extract and vinegar and whisk until no dry lumps remain. Take care not to over-beat the batter</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared tin and spread it level. Scatter over the cherries and flaked almonds</li>
            <li>Bake the cake for about 35 minutes until pale golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean</li>
            <li>Leave the cake to cool completely in the tin before slicing it</li>
