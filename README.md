# odin-recipes

For this project I will be building a basic recipe website.

The aim for this project is to put into practice the foundation HTML knowledge I have been learning, and provide a starting point for a further project in the future where CSS knowledge can be demonstrated.

Therefore the objectives for this project are to demonstrate:

- How to create a new repository on GitHub and clone it onto my local machine
- The creation of a main index page which can then be used to move via links to a few different recipe pages
- The correct use of Git commit
- Closing of the GitHub cycle
